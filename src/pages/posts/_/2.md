So, today I was redesigning the frontpage. Yesterday when I created the URL shortener I also picked up on [pico css](https://picocss.com/). I really liked the minimalist design so I gave it a try. I must say it is easy to use and provides you with really great classes.

Then I used pico css in combination with font awesome and created my landing page. I really looks better than before and I may even say for this once, it doesn't suck.
