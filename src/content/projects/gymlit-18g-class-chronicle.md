My class maintains a chronicle. One they I may have thrown this book from the 4th floor... That may have made me feel bad, so I have created an online version of it. It uses the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework with SSR. The whole website is for Czech speakers and should be accessed mainly by people interested in the topic. It does not serve a purpose to humiliate anyone.
